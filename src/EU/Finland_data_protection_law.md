A controller is a person, corporation, institution or foundation, or a number of them, for the use of whom a personal data file is set up and who is entitled to determine the use of the file, or who has been designated as a controller by an Act.



Note that public electronic communications services are subject to [*Act No. 516/2004*](http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2004/en20040516.pdf); amendments up to 365/2011 included.
