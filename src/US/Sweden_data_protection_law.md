######General data protection law



The main law governing the use of personal data in Sweden is the Personal Data Act (1998:204).



-   [*Data protection law*](http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/01/55/42/b451922d.pdf) (English)



######Who and what the law applies to



The law applies to data controllers and the complete or partial automated processing of personal data. It also applies to the manual processing of personal data if the data is included in or is intended to form part of a structured collection of personal data that is available for searching or compilation (a filing system).



A controller is a person who alone or together with others decides the purpose and means of processing personal data.



*Note that certain sectors are subject to industry-specific legislation. For example, public electronic communications services are subject to the Electronic Communications Act (2003:369), the healthcare sector is subject to the Patients’ Personal Data Act (2008:355); and credit information is subject to the Credit Information Act (1973:1173). Provisions of these laws are not included here.*



######How the law defines a personal data breach



The law does not provide an explicit definition of a personal data breach.



######How the law defines personal data



*Personal data* means all kinds of information that directly or indirectly may be referable to a natural person who is alive.



*Sensitive personal data* means personal data that reveals race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or membership of a trade union.



Sensitive data or data with special processing provisions also includes information related to a person’s health or sex life, criminal records, and a person’s personal identity or classification numbers.



Processing sensitive data is prohibited except in certain circumstances.



######Does the law require that affected individuals or regulatory entities be notified in the event of a breach?



For a personal data representative, there is an obligation to notify the Data Inspection Board if the representative has reason to suspect that the controller contravenes the provisions applicable for processing personal data (the representative suspects a data breach) and if rectification is not implemented as soon as is practicable after being pointed out.



######Exceptions to breach notification requirements



The law does not define exceptions to the notification obligations of a personal data representative.



######Required breach notification methods and contents



The law does not define notification methods and contents.

The law applies to:
