A controller is a natural person or legal person or other public or private sector person which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data or a person provided by statute that also determines the purposes and means of processing.



A processor is a natural person or legal person that processes personal data on behalf and for the account of the data controller.

######How the law defines a personal data breach

######How the law defines personal data



*Personal data* means any data relating to an individual, irrespective of the form in which it is expressed. Personal data includes reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to the individual's physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.



*Sensitive data* means data on racial, national or ethnic origin, political, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, health status, sexual life, the entry in or removal from criminal record or records of minor offences; biometric characteristics are also sensitive personal data if their use makes it possible to identify an individual in connection with any of the aforementioned circumstances.



Biometric characteristics are defined as:



-   physical, physiological and behavioural characteristics which all individuals have but which are unique and permanent for each individual specifically and which can be used to identify an individual, in particular by the use of fingerprint, recording of papillary ridges of the finger, iris scan, retinal scan, recording of facial characteristics, recording of an ear, DNA scan and characteristic gait.



Processing sensitive data is prohibited except in certain circumstances.



######Does the law require that affected individuals or regulatory entities be notified in the event of a breach?



There is no legal requirement to notify individuals or regulatory agencies following a breach of personal data although voluntary notification may be considered a best practice.
