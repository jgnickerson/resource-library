<h6>General data protection law</h6>

<p>The main law governing the use of personal data in Ireland is the Data Protection Act 1988, amended by the Data Protection Act 2003 (DPA).</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0006/index.html"><em>Data protection law</em></a></li></ul>

<h6>Who and what the law applies to</h6>

<p>The law applies to the automated or manual processing of personal data by a data controller or processor.</p>

<p>A controller is a person who, either alone or with others, controls the contents and use of personal data.</p>

<p>A processor is a person who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller, but does not include an employee of a data controller who processes such data in the course of his employment.</p>

<p><em>Note that public electronic communications services are subject to the</em> <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/documents/legal/SI336of2011.pdf"><strong>ePrivacy Regulations 2011</strong></a> <em>(S.I. 336 of 2011). Provisions of this law are not included here.</em></p>

<h6>How the law defines a personal data breach</h6>

<p>The Code does not provide an explicit definition of a personal data breach although a breach is considered to be a situation where personal data has been put at risk of unauthorized disclosure, loss, destruction, or alteration.</p>

<h6>How the law defines personal data</h6>

<p><em>Personal data</em> means data relating to a living individual who is or can be identified either from the data or from the data in conjunction with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the possession of the data controller.</p>

<p><em>Sensitive personal data</em> means personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs, whether the data subject is a member of a trade union, physical or mental health or condition or sexual life, the commission or alleged commission of any offence, any proceedings for an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by the data subject, and the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.</p>

<p>Processing <em>s</em>ensitive data is prohibited except in certain circumstances.</p>

<h6>Does the law require that affected individuals or regulatory entities be notified in the event of a breach?</h6>

<p>The DPA does not oblige data controllers to notify individuals or regulatory agencies following a breach of personal data. However, the Code does.</p>

<p>A data controller should notify the DPC following a breach as soon as the data controller becomes aware of the incident or within two working days. A data controller is also obliged to notify affected data subjects without delay.</p>

<p>A data processor is also obliged to give immediate consideration to notifying affected data subjects.</p>

<h6>Exceptions to breach notification requirements</h6>

<p>The Code allows an exception for notifying data subjects If the data concerned is protected by technological measures such as to make it unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it. Such a conclusion would only be justified where the technological measures (such as encryption) were of a high standard.</p>

<p>The Code also allows an exception for notifying the DPC when the full extent and consequences of the incident has been reported without delay directly to the affected data subjects and it affects no more than 100 data subjects and it does not include sensitive personal data or personal data of a financial nature.</p>

<h6>Required breach notification methods and contents</h6>

<p>Notification to the DPC must include an outline of the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>

<p>The notification may be deliveree by e-mail (preferably), telephone or fax and must not involve the communication of personal data.</p>

<p>The Code does not define notification methods and contents for affected data subjects.</p>

<h6>Where the law applies (jurisdiction)</h6>

<p>The law applies to:</p>

<ul><li><p>the processing of personal data by a controller who is established in Ireland.</p></li><li><p>the processing of personal data on equipment located in Ireland by a controller who is not established in a state that’s part of the EU or EEA, except if the means are used for transit only.</p></li></ul>

<h6>Additional definitions</h6>

<p><em>Data subject</em> means an individual who is the subject of personal data.</p>

<p><em>Processing</em> means performing any operation or set of operations on the information or data, whether or not by automatic means, including:</p>

<ul><li><p>obtaining, recording or keeping the information or data.</p></li><li><p>collecting, organising, storing, altering or adapting the information or data.</p></li><li><p>retrieving, consulting or using the information or data.</p></li><li><p>disclosing the information or data by transmitting, disseminating or otherwise making it available.</p></li><li><p>aligning, combining, blocking, erasing or destroying the information or data.</p></li></ul>
