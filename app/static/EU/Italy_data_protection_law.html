<h6>General data protection law</h6>

<p>The main law governing the use of personal data in Italy is the Personal Data Protection Code - Legislative Decree no. 196/2003.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://194.242.234.211/documents/10160/2012405/DataProtectionCode-2003.pdf"><em>Data protection law</em></a> (English)</li></ul>

<h6>Who and what the law applies to</h6>

<p>The law applies to the processing of personal information with or without the help of electronic or other automated means by data controllers, processors, and anyone person in charge of the processing of personal information.</p>

<p>The law also applies to providers of public electronic communications services.</p>

<p>A controller is any natural or legal person, public administration, body, association or other entity that is competent, also jointly with another data controller, to determine purposes and methods of the processing of personal data and the relevant means, including security matters.</p>

<p><em>Note that additional data breach notification obligations exist for banks and financial institutions per a 12 May 2011 decision by Italy’s data protection authority, the Garante per la protezione dei dati personali (hereafter, Garante). These obligations are not included here.</em></p>

<h6>How the law defines a personal data breach</h6>

<p><em>Personal data breach</em> means a security breach leading, accidentally or not, to the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed in the context of the provision of a publicly available communications service.</p>

<h6>How the law defines personal data</h6>

<p><em>Personal data</em> means any information relating to natural persons that are or can be identified, even indirectly, by reference to any other information including a personal identification number.</p>

<p><em>Identification data</em> means personal data allowing a data subject to be identified directly.</p>

<p><em>Sensitive data</em> means personal data allowing the disclosure of racial or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or other beliefs, political opinions, membership of parties, trade unions, associations or organizations of a religious, philosophical, political or trade-unionist character, as well as personal data disclosing health and sex life.</p>

<p><em>Judicial data</em> means personal data disclosing the measures referred to in Section 3(1), letters a) to o) and r) to u), of Presidential Decree no. 313 of 14 November 2002 concerning the criminal record office, the register of offence-related administrative sanctions and the relevant current charges, or the status of being either defendant or the subject of investigations pursuant to Sections 60 and 61 of the Criminal Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Processing <em>s</em>ensitive data is prohibited except in certain circumstances.</p>

<h6>Does the law require that affected individuals or regulatory entities be notified in the event of a breach?</h6>

<p>There is no general requirement to notify affected individuals or regulatory entities in the event of a breach although voluntary notification may be considered a best practice.</p>

<p>For providers of publicly available electronic communications services only, there is a requirement to notify without undue delay the Garante and the Authority for Communication Safeguards.</p>

<p>If the personal data breach is likely to be detrimental to the personal data or privacy of the contracting party or another individual, the provider is also required to notify the contracting party or the individual without delay.</p>

<h6>Exceptions to breach notification requirements</h6>

<p>Notification is not required if the provider has demonstrated to the Garante that technological protection measures were implemented that render the data unintelligible to any entity that is not authorised to access it.</p>

<h6>Required breach notification methods and contents</h6>

<p>The breach notification to the contracting party or individual shall at least include a description of the nature of the personal data breach and the contact points where additional information can be obtained, and shall list the measures recommended to mitigate the possible detrimental effects of the personal data breach.</p>

<p>The notification to the Garante shall describe, in addition, the consequences of the personal data breach and the measures proposed or taken by the provider to remedy the breach. This information shall also be provided to the Authority for Communications Safeguards.</p>

<ul><li><p>the processing of personal data in Italy or in a place where Italian law applies.</p></li><li><p>the processing of personal data on equipment located in Italy by an entity not established in the EU, except where the equipment is used solely for the transfer of data through the EU.
