<h6>General data protection law</h6>

<p>The main law governing the use of personal data in Germany is the Federal Data Protection Act.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bdsg/englisch_bdsg.html#p0008"><em>Data protection law</em></a> (English)</li></ul>

<h6>Who and what the law applies to</h6>

<p>The law applies to the collection, processing, and use of personal data by a data controller in so far as they process or use data by means of data processing systems or collect data for such systems, process or use data in or from non-automated filing systems or collect data for such systems. The law also applies to data processors.</p>

<p>A controller is any any person or body collecting, processing or using personal data on his or its own behalf or commissioning others to do the same, including public bodies of the Federation, public bodies of the Länder in so far as data protection is not governed by Land legislation, and private bodies.</p>

<p>A processor is a public or private body processing personal data on behalf of others.</p>

<p><em>Note that public electronic communications services (such as websites, ISPs and commercial email) are subject to the German Telemedia Act. Provisions of the Act are not included here.</em></p>

<h6>How the law defines a personal data breach</h6>

<p>Although not explicitly defined, a breach is considered to be an incident where a public or private body determines that personal data stored with the body has been unlawfully transferred or otherwise unlawfully revealed to third parties, with the threat of serious harm to the data subject’s rights or legitimate interests.</p>

<h6>How the law defines personal data</h6>

<p>Personal data means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual (the data subject).</p>

<p>The law also defines special categories of personal data. These categories include information on a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions, union membership, health or sex life.</p>

<p>Additional provisions apply to the processing of special categories of personal data as well as the processing of information regarding criminal or administrative offences, personal data concerning bank or credit card accounts, and personal data subject to professional or official secrecy, in particular tax secrecy.</p>

<h6>Does the law require that affected individuals or regulatory entities be notified in the event of a breach?</h6>

<p>In the event of a breach, a private or public body shall notify the responsible supervisory authority and the data subject without delay.</p>

<p>The data subject shall be notified as soon as appropriate measures have been taken to protect the data and notification would no longer put criminal prosecution at risk.</p>

<h6>Exceptions to breach notification requirements</h6>

<p>The law does not provide exceptions to the notification obligations of a private or public body.</p>

<h6>Required breach notification methods and contents</h6>

<p>The notification for data subjects shall describe the nature of the unlawful access and include recommendations for measures to minimize possible harm.</p>

<p>The notification for the competent supervisory authority shall also describe possible harmful consequences of the unlawful access and measures taken by the body.</p>

<p>Where notifying the data subjects would require unreasonable effort, in particular due to the large number of cases involved, notification may be replaced by public advertisements of at least one-half page in at least two national daily newspapers, or by another equally effective measure for notifying the data subjects.</p>

<h6>Where the law applies (jurisdiction)</h6>

<p>The law applies to:</p>

<ul><li><p>the collection, processing, or use of personal data by a controller located in Germany.</p></li><li><p>the collection, processing, or use of personal data by a controller located in an EU or EEA country except where such collection, processing, or use is carried out by a branch in Germany.</p></li><li><p>the collection, processing, or use of personal data in Germany by a controller not located in an EU or EEA country, except for the purposes of transit through Germany only.</p></li></ul>
