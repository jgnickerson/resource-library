<h6>General data protection law</h6>

<p>The main data protection law in Austria is the Federal Act Concerning the Protection of Personal Data (DSG 2000), with amendments through 2014.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.dsb.gv.at/DocView.axd?CobId=41936"><em>Data protection law</em></a> (English)</li></ul>

<h6>Who and what the law applies to</h6>

<p>The law applies to the automated processing of personal data by controllers and processors. It also applies to the manual processing of personal data for the purposes of a structured filing system.</p>

<p>A controller is a natural or legal person, group of persons or organ of a territorial corporate body or the offices of these organs, who, alone or jointly, determines the purpose and manner of using personal data, whether they use the data themselves or have it done by others.</p>

<p>A processor is a natural or legal person, group of persons or organ of a federal, state and local authority or the offices of these organs who uses data as commissioned work for a controller.</p>

<p>Note that Austria has additional industry-specific data laws including the <a href="https://www.rtr.at/en/tk/TKG2003"><em>Telecommunications Act 2003</em></a> which applies to public electronic communications services. Provisions of the Act are not included here.</p>

<h6>How the law defines a personal data breach</h6>

<p>A breach occurs when a controller learns that data are systematically and seriously misused and the data subject may suffer damages.</p>

<h6>How the law defines personal data</h6>

<p><em>Personal data</em> means information relating to data subjects (natural or legal persons) who are identified or identifiable.</p>

<p><em>Sensitive personal data</em> means data relating to natural persons concerning their racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, trade-union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, and data concerning health or sex life.</p>

<p>Processing sensitive data is prohibited except in certain circumstances.</p>

<h6>Does the law require that affected individuals or regulatory entities be notified in the event of a breach?</h6>

<p>Yes. A data subject must be notified immediately following a breach.</p>

<h6>Exceptions to breach notification requirements</h6>

<p>The obligation to notify a data subject following a breach does not exist if the information – taking into consideration that only minor damage to the data subject is likely and the cost of the information to all persons concerned – would require an inappropriate effort.</p>

<h6>Required breach notification methods and contents</h6>

<p>Data subjects should be notified in an appropriate manner although method and notification contents are not defined by the law.</p>

<h6>Where the law applies (jurisdiction)</h6>

<p>The law applies to:</p>

<ul><li><p>the use of personal data in Austria.</p></li><li><p>the use of personal data outside of Austria when the data is used in another EU country for purposes of a controller’s main or branch establishment in Austria, expect for purposes of transit only.</p></li></ul>
