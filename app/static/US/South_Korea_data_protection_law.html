<h6>How the law defines a personal data breach</h6>

<p>The law does not provide an explicit definition of a personal data breach, but describes a breach as when “personal information is leaked.”</p>

<h6>How the law defines personal data</h6>

<p><em>Personal information</em> is broadly defined to mean information pertaining to any living person that makes it possible to identify such individual by his or her name and resident registration number or image. Personal information includes information which, by itself, does not identify a specific individual, but makes it possible to identify a specific individual if combined with other information.</p>

<p><em>Sensitive personal data</em> means personal information including ideology, belief, admission or exit to and from trade unions or political parties, political mindset, health, sexual life, and other personal information which is likely to harm the privacy of data subjects, as stated by the Presidential Decree (i.e. DNA information or criminal history data).</p>

<p>Processing sensitive data is prohibited except in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Additional limitations apply to the processing of unique identifiers (resident registration number, passport number, driver’s license number, or alien registration number), to the installation and operation of visual data processing devices, to the consignment of personal information for processing by a third party, and to the transfer of personal information following a business transfer.</p>

<h6>Does the law require that affected individuals or regulatory entities be notified in the event of a breach?</h6>

<p>Yes. When a personal information processor becomes aware that personal information has been leaked, there is an obligation to notify affected individuals without delay, provided that the personal information processor may give notice to the data subjects without delay right after it has taken contingent measures, including shut-down of access route, check-up of weak point and deletion of leaked personal data, necessary to prevent the dissemination of leaked data and additional leakage.</p>

<p>If the personal information processor takes contingent measures after becoming aware of the data breach, but can not confirm what kind of personal information was leaked or when and how personal information was leaked, the personal information processor is allowed to first notify data subjects of the data breach then confirm additional facts later.</p>

<p>In the event of a large scale data breach above 10,000 data subjects:</p>

<ul><li><p>In addition to notification in writing, etc. the personal information processor shall post the notification on its website for more than seven (7) days. If the personal information processor does not operate the website, they shall post the notification at easily noticeable places like the workplace for more than seven (7) days.</p></li><li><p>The personal information processor shall, without delay, report the notification as well as the result of countermeasures prepared to minimize the damage to the Minister of Public Administration and Security and the National Information Agency (NIA) or the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA).</p></li></ul>

<h6>Exceptions to breach notification requirements</h6>

<p>The law does not define exceptions to notification obligations.</p>

<h6>Required breach notification methods and contents</h6>

<p>Notifications to affected individuals should include the following information:</p>

<ul><li><p>What kind of personal information was leaked.</p></li><li><p>When and how personal information was leaked.</p></li><li><p>Any information on how the data subject can minimize probable damage suffered from personal information disclosure.</p></li><li><p>Countermeasures of the personal information processor and remedial procedure.</p></li><li><p>Contact information for the Help desk of the personal information processor so data subjects can report sufferings.</p></li></ul>

<p>The law defines notification methods as “in writing, etc.”</p>

<h6>Where the law applies (jurisdiction)</h6>

<p>The law does not explicitly define its jurisdiction, although it’s generally accepted that PIPA applies to both South Korean companies and to companies established abroad that process the personal information of South Korean citizens.</p>

<h6>Additional definitions</h6>
