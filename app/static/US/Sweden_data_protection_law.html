<h6>Who and what the law applies to</h6>

<p>The law applies to data controllers and the complete or partial automated processing of personal data. It also applies to the manual processing of personal data if the data is included in or is intended to form part of a structured collection of personal data that is available for searching or compilation (a filing system).</p>

<p>A controller is a person who alone or together with others decides the purpose and means of processing personal data.</p>

<p><em>Note that certain sectors are subject to industry-specific legislation. For example, public electronic communications services are subject to the Electronic Communications Act (2003:369), the healthcare sector is subject to the Patients’ Personal Data Act (2008:355); and credit information is subject to the Credit Information Act (1973:1173). Provisions of these laws are not included here.</em></p>
